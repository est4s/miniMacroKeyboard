Macro Keyboard is a keyboard with buttons from F13 to F22. First 5 button are for key functions, the last one is for bank change function. It has an RGB led inside to indicate which bank is used. On the prototype Oetomu mechanical switches are used, Cherry MX's will work just fine. It it powered by an Arduino Pro Micro. 

The code can be configured to be used for different shortcuts, and can be manipulated to add more banks to it. The reason that I made 2 banks is F22 is the last function key that can be used in Windows.

Design will be improved, this is the first prototype both for 3d model, print and Arduino code.
